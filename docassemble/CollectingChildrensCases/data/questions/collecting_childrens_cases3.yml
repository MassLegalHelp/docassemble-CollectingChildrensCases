  Using Jonathan's example of nested for loops in Groups Example blocks below.
  We want one fewer levels of depth, and I don't think we need a generic object - maybe we do
  Each case in our list of cases has attributes - I think - which Jonathan's example does not have.

objects:
  - children: ChildList.using(object_type=Individual, complete_attribute='complete') 
  - children[i].cases: DAList.using(object_type=Thing, complete_attribute='complete')

mandatory: True
code: |
  children.ask_number = True
  children[i].name.first
  children[i].cases.there_are_any
  children[i].cases[j].parent_role
  children[i].cases[j].complete = True
  children.complete = True
---
mandatory: True
question: |
  List of children
subquestion: |
  and their cases
  % for child in children:
    if children[i].cases.there_are_any:
     * Care and Custody proceedings for ${ child }:
      for case in children[i].cases:
        * ${child}'s  ${ordinal(j)} case
          * was in ${case.court} court
          * with docket number: ${case.docket},
          * status is ${case.status}, and
          * parent's role was ${case.parent_role}.
      endfor
     else
       ${child} is not nor ever has been involved in any Care or Custody proceeding.
